Civilization Game

Instructions:
  Civilization is a competitive game of saving money. Each of the four(4) players start off with 0 unit money (EARNINGS). 
  For every turn (in a total of 4 turns), they obtain 1 unit money. They could choose to either BOYCOTT (avoid) donating their money to the bank, 
  which means they could keep it in earnings, OR, they could choose to DONATE it to the BANK. After a set (4 turns) the banks money inflates
  and is divided to every players in proportion to their donations. Players with the most EARNINGS win the game.
